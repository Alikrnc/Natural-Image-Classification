# Natural-Image-Classification
Deep Learning Course Project Work - A Compiled Dataset of 6899 Images From 8 Distinct Classes / Natural Images Dataset (Kaggle)

# Introduction:

Within the scope of this project, it is aimed to learn the basic concepts of deep learning applications.

This model was created as a deep learning course assignment during my undergraduate education. Since it is a student-level project, I cannot guarantee the quality of the project. Additionally, since I have to stick to the methods given in the assignment, the path or methods and codes I follow may not be efficient.
